                        Amer fort is 15 kms from the Jaipur city. We travelled there by a ola cab. Hired a jeep to reach the entrance for Rs 550 per jeep ride for up and down with 2 hrs waiting. 
                        The entrance fee is reduced to almost less than half for students with valid Id proof. We hired a guide at the jeep stand also for Rs 400. The place is a worth visit if you are in Jaipur. There are some and 
                        old and new constructions in the place. Guide was of great help as explained the historical importance of the place. It's beautiful with carvings, paintings of vegetable colour, rooms of queens and kings, sheesh Mahal.
                         A beautiful monument with exceptional history. Just loved the whole experience!! The only annoying thing is that the drivers of cabs, rickshaw etc all cheat a lot. The tourists have to be really careful.
